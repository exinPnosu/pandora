Ven Te Chow's Applied Hydrology book was published in 1988 and covers a wide range of topics in hydrology, such as precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, runoff, hydrographs, flood routing, groundwater, frequency analysis, water quality, and water resources management. The book is divided into 14 chapters, each with a set of problems at the end. The problems are designed to test your understanding of the concepts and methods presented in the book and to apply them to real-world situations.
 
Unfortunately, the book does not provide any solutions or hints for the problems, which can make it challenging for students and instructors alike. However, there are some ways to overcome this difficulty and learn how to solve the problems effectively. Here are some suggestions:
 
- Review the theory and examples in the book carefully before attempting the problems. Make sure you understand the assumptions, equations, and procedures used in each topic.
- Use online resources such as [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/43248725/Hidrologia_aplicada_ventechow), [Scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/351908560/Solucion-problemas-Ven-Te-Chow-Hidrologia-aplicada), or [Idoc.pub](https://idoc.pub/documents/solucion-problemas-ven-te-chow-hidrologia-aplicada-x4e6y3mggmn3) to find solutions or partial solutions for some of the problems from other students or instructors who have shared their work online. However, be careful not to copy the solutions blindly and make sure you understand the steps and logic behind them.
- Use online calculators or software tools such as [HydroOffice](https://www.hydrooffice.org/), [HEC](https://www.hydrologicengineering.com/), or [SWMM](https://swmm5.org/) to perform some of the calculations or simulations required for some of the problems. However, be careful not to rely on these tools too much and make sure you know how to do the calculations by hand or with a spreadsheet if needed.
- Use online forums or communities such as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrology/), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/topic/Hydrology), or [Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Hydrology) to ask questions or seek help from other hydrology enthusiasts or experts who may have solved similar problems or have experience with the book.
- Work with your classmates or peers who are also using the book and collaborate on solving the problems together. You can learn from each other's perspectives and approaches and check each other's work for errors or inconsistencies.
- Consult your instructor or tutor if you are taking a course based on the book and ask for guidance or feedback on your solutions. They may be able to provide you with hints, tips, or additional resources to help you solve the problems.

To illustrate how to solve some of the problems from Ven Te Chow's Applied Hydrology book, we will use two examples from Chapter 7 (Runoff) and Chapter 12 (Frequency Analysis). These are not official solutions and may contain errors or inaccuracies. They are only meant to demonstrate one possible way of solving the problems using some of the resources mentioned above.
